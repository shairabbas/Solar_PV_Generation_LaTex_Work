\begin{abstract}
	As renewable energy penetration accelerates globally, accurate solar photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting has transitioned from a research curiosity to an operational necessity for maintaining grid stability and optimizing energy dispatch. Despite substantial progress in developing machine learning and deep learning forecasting models over the past decade, the research community faces a persistent challenge: most studies employ disparate datasets, inconsistent evaluation protocols, and heterogeneous preprocessing methods, rendering cross-study performance comparisons unreliable. We address this critical gap by introducing a rigorously standardized benchmarking framework that evaluates six representative forecasting architectures under identical experimental conditions. Our investigation encompasses gradient-boosted tree ensembles (XGBoost and Random Forest), recurrent neural networks (LSTM and GRU), a hybrid attention mechanism (CNN-BiGRU-Attention), and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS-SC). Using five years of hourly meteorological and irradiance data (2020--2024) from Hengsha Island, Shanghai, we maintain strict chronological data partitioning (60\% training, 20\% validation, 20\% testing) and evaluate all models using five complementary metrics: coefficient of determination (R\textsuperscript{2}), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE), and skill score relative to 24-hour persistence. Our experimental results reveal a clear performance hierarchy. \textbf{XGBoost emerges as the dominant approach, achieving near-perfect prediction accuracy (R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.9994, RMSE = 0.0009 normalized units)}, demonstrating its exceptional capability in capturing complex solar-meteorological relationships through iterative gradient boosting. Random Forest closely trails with R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.9978, confirming the robustness of ensemble tree methods for this application domain. Remarkably, ANFIS-SC secures third position (R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.9886, Skill Score = 0.8025) despite its relatively simple architecture, highlighting the value of interpretable neuro-fuzzy systems where operational transparency matters. The recurrent architectures---GRU (R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.9309) and LSTM (R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.9063)---deliver respectable performance and effectively model temporal dependencies, though they require more careful hyperparameter tuning and larger datasets to fully realize their potential. In contrast, the attention-based hybrid CNN-BiGRU model substantially underperforms (R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.5424), suggesting that sophisticated architectures without domain-aware constraints may actually degrade prediction quality. Residual diagnostic analysis confirms that top-performing models maintain homoscedastic error distributions and exhibit minimal systematic bias across all power generation regimes. To maximize research reproducibility and practical impact, we release the complete implementation framework as open-source software. This work provides energy system operators and researchers with evidence-based decision criteria for model selection, balancing accuracy requirements against interpretability needs and computational constraints.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Solar photovoltaic (PV) generation is experiencing unprecedented global expansion, driven by declining installation costs and ambitious decarbonization targets \citep{renewableenergyagency2023,energy2021optimization}. However, unlike conventional dispatchable power sources, solar energy exhibits inherent stochasticity across temporal scales ranging from seconds to seasons. Cloud passage events can induce sub-minute ramp rates exceeding 50\% of installed capacity, while seasonal solar declination variations create predictable yet substantial diurnal generation patterns \citep{forecast2022solar,yang2020survey}. This dual nature---combining deterministic astronomical cycles with stochastic atmospheric processes---poses fundamental challenges for power system operators tasked with maintaining instantaneous supply-demand equilibrium.

The operational imperative for accurate PV forecasting intensifies as grid penetration levels increase \citep{renewableenergyagency2023}. System operators rely on forecast horizons spanning minutes to days to orchestrate multiple operational functions: optimizing battery energy storage dispatch while minimizing degradation from excessive cycling, coordinating flexible demand response programs, maintaining spinning reserves at economically optimal levels, and enabling profitable participation in day-ahead wholesale electricity markets \citep{energy2021optimization,costanalysis2021}. Forecast errors impose tangible economic and reliability penalties. Conservative under-forecasts necessitate maintaining expensive standby generation capacity, while optimistic over-forecasts can trigger frequency deviations requiring emergency load shedding or, in extreme cases, cascading grid failures \citep{costanalysis2021}. Recent studies quantify these impacts, estimating that each 1\% improvement in forecast accuracy can reduce annual operating costs by millions of dollars for utility-scale installations.

\subsection{Current State of PV Forecasting Research}

The literature on PV power forecasting has evolved considerably over the past fifteen years, progressing from simple persistence models and autoregressive moving average (ARIMA) formulations to sophisticated machine learning and deep neural network architectures \citep{machinelearning2021survey,forecasting2020advances,pedro2012ml}. Researchers have investigated ensemble methods including Random Forests and gradient boosting variants, support vector regression with various kernel functions, and recurrent neural architectures such as long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRU). More recent work explores convolutional networks for spatiotemporal feature extraction and attention mechanisms that dynamically weight input features according to their relevance \citep{shi2022attention}. While individual studies frequently report impressive performance metrics, a critical methodological problem undermines the field's collective progress: the absence of standardized experimental protocols makes meaningful cross-study comparisons nearly impossible \citep{benchmark2022limitations,yang2020survey}.

This fragmentation manifests in several dimensions. Different researchers select different geographic locations with fundamentally different climatological conditions---comparing performance between tropical equatorial sites and temperate mid-latitude regions tells us more about climate zones than modeling approaches. Studies vary wildly in temporal granularity (1-minute to daily intervals), forecast horizons (nowcasting to multi-day ahead), and data sources (ground stations versus satellite retrievals versus numerical weather predictions). Perhaps most problematically, many published works violate basic principles of time-series validation by randomly shuffling observations before splitting into training and testing sets, an approach that artificially inflates performance by allowing models to effectively \"see into the future\" through temporal autocorrelation \citep{yang2020survey,benchmark2022limitations}. Asymmetric feature engineering further confounds comparisons---some studies provide deep learning models with raw sensor readings while feeding pre-engineered features to traditional methods, creating unfair competitive conditions that favor neither paradigm consistently \citep{deepvstraditional2020debate}.

\subsection{Motivation: Addressing the Benchmarking Gap}

The solar forecasting research community urgently needs standardized experimental protocols that enable apples-to-apples model comparisons. An effective benchmarking framework must satisfy several requirements simultaneously. First, all candidate models must process identical input data subjected to uniform preprocessing transformations---no selective feature engineering that advantages specific architectures. Second, data partitioning must respect temporal causality through strictly chronological train-validation-test splits that mirror real-world deployment scenarios \citep{yang2020survey}. Third, evaluation must employ multiple complementary metrics rather than cherry-picking favorable measures; a model that minimizes absolute errors might simultaneously exhibit poor correlation structure, and both characteristics matter for operational decision-making \citep{benchmark2022limitations}. Fourth, baseline comparisons against naive methods (such as persistence forecasting) provide essential context for interpreting performance claims. Finally, complete methodological transparency and code availability enable independent verification and facilitate adoption by practitioners \citep{deepvstraditional2020debate,forecast2022solar}.

Existing benchmarking efforts, while valuable, typically fall short on one or more criteria. Some frameworks compare only 2-3 model types, insufficiently sampling the algorithmic design space. Others lack extended temporal coverage, testing only single-season or single-year datasets that may not capture inter-annual climate variations. Perhaps most critically, few studies release their complete implementations, preventing independent reproducibility audits and limiting real-world applicability.

\subsection{Contribution of This Work}

This study presents a comprehensive benchmarking framework for solar PV power forecasting that addresses these methodological gaps. Based on initial screening of ten candidate models, we focus on six representative approaches spanning three paradigms: (i) two gradient-boosted ensembles (XGBoost, Random Forest) \citep{machinelearning2021survey}, (ii) two recurrent neural networks (LSTM, GRU) \citep{forecasting2020advances}, (iii) one hybrid deep architecture (CNN-BiGRU-Attention) \citep{shi2022attention}, and (iv) one neuro-fuzzy model (ANFIS-SC). This focused selection captures the full methodological spectrum from ensemble learning to attention-based deep hybrids and interpretable fuzzy systems, while avoiding redundancy. All models are trained on identical data with consistent preprocessing, evaluated using unified metrics \citep{benchmark2022limitations}, and validated through chronological train/validation/test splits \citep{yang2020survey} across an extended 5-year period (2020--2024) on high-quality NASA POWER and local meteorological data from Hengsha Island, Shanghai, China.

Key contributions are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Standardized benchmarking framework}: A reproducible, open-source pipeline ensuring fair comparison across algorithmic paradigms with identical data splits, metrics, and baselines.
	\item \textbf{Representative model coverage}: Six carefully selected models representing traditional ML ensembles, deep recurrent architectures, hybrid attention networks, and neuro-fuzzy systems---balancing scientific rigor with purposeful design.
	\item \textbf{Unified evaluation metrics}: Application of five complementary metrics ($R^2$, RMSE, MAE, sMAPE, Skill Score) to characterize model performance across multiple dimensions, supplemented by scenario-based analysis.
	\item \textbf{Extended validation period}: Use of 5 years of hourly data to ensure robustness across seasonal and inter-annual variability.
	\item \textbf{Actionable insights}: Clear guidance on model selection based on operational constraints (real-time vs. day-ahead, computational budget, interpretability).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Paper Organization}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:method} describes the data, preprocessing pipeline, model architectures, and unified evaluation framework. Section~\ref{sec:results} presents comparative results across all ten models, identifying top performers and characterizing their strengths and weaknesses.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

Early PV forecasting relied on statistical and physical models such as persistence, ARIMA, and numerical weather prediction (NWP) downscaling. These methods offered transparent baselines but struggled with rapidly changing cloud conditions and site-specific biases \citep{forecast2022solar,energy2021optimization}. Ensemble tree methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) emerged next, leveraging handcrafted meteorological features to capture nonlinear irradiance-power relationships while retaining modest computational cost \citep{machinelearning2021survey}.

Deep learning approaches broadened the design space to include convolutional, recurrent, and attention-based architectures that model spatiotemporal dependencies in irradiance and meteorology \citep{forecasting2020advances}. CNNs capture local temporal patterns, while LSTM/GRU networks encode diurnal seasonality and regime shifts. Hybrid CNN-RNN or attention models promise improved long-horizon accuracy, though they often require large datasets and careful regularization to avoid overfitting \citep{shi2022attention}.

Recent literature highlights persistent benchmarking issues: inconsistent data splits, heterogeneous preprocessing, and metric cherry-picking limit cross-paper comparability \citep{benchmark2022limitations,deepvstraditional2020debate,yang2020survey}. Standardization efforts advocate chronological train/validation/test partitions, unified feature pipelines, and transparent baselines (e.g., 24-hour persistence) to ensure fair evaluation. Our work aligns with these recommendations by providing a unified, open-source framework that tests diverse model families under identical conditions and reports complementary metrics.

Satellite and sky-imager driven approaches integrate cloud motion vectors with optical flow and CNN backbones for intra-hour forecasts; however, the hardware and labeling overhead limit transferability to data-sparse sites \citep{forecast2022solar,chu2015hybrid}. NWP-ensemble post-processing with quantile regression or gradient boosting improves probabilistic forecasts but inherits biases from coarse-resolution weather grids \citep{energy2021optimization,alessandrini2015prob}. Probabilistic methods (quantile regression forests, conformal prediction) increasingly accompany point forecasts to convey uncertainty \citep{pedro2012ml}, yet few benchmarks report both deterministic and calibrated probabilistic scores on identical splits. Explainability tools such as SHAP values help operators audit model drivers and complement black-box deep models \citep{lundberg2017shap}. We explicitly retain a persistence baseline to anchor comparisons and highlight incremental value over physics-free references.

\label{sec:method}

\subsection{Dataset and Data Preprocessing}

\subsubsection{Data Source}

Hourly solar irradiance and meteorological data were obtained from the NASA POWER database for Hengsha Island, Shanghai, China (31.3403°N, 121.8389°E) spanning January 2020 to December 2024. The dataset contains 43,824 hourly records including Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI), surface air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. Missing values (< 0.1\%) were interpolated using linear interpolation.

Table~\ref{tab:summary_stats} provides comprehensive descriptive statistics for all input features and the target variable (normalized PV power). The summary statistics reveal substantial variability in key meteorological parameters over the five-year observation period. Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) ranges from 20.05 W/m\textsuperscript{2} to 1,036.35 W/m\textsuperscript{2}, with a mean value of 338.96 W/m\textsuperscript{2} and standard deviation of 244.53 W/m\textsuperscript{2}. The clearness index ($k_t$) varies from 0.026 to 1.5, averaging 0.45, indicating diverse atmospheric transmission conditions. Surface air temperature (T2M) fluctuates between --4.28°C and 35.7°C, with a mean of 19.20°C and standard deviation of 8.17°C, reflecting the subtropical monsoon climate. Relative humidity (RH2M) ranges from 36.33\% to 100\%, averaging 76.89\%, while wind speed (WS10M) varies between 0.04 m/s and 25.23 m/s with a mean of 5.69 m/s and standard deviation of 2.67 m/s. The normalized PV power output ranges from 0.0036 to 0.1902 per-unit, with a mean of 0.0622 and standard deviation of 0.0445, demonstrating the target variable's substantial dynamic range across different solar conditions.

The dataset exhibits strong seasonal patterns (Figure~\ref{fig:monthly_climate}), with peak GHI occurring in August (224 W/m\textsuperscript{2}) and minimum in December (100 W/m\textsuperscript{2}). Air temperature follows the expected subtropical monsoon pattern, ranging from 6°C (January) to 28°C (July-August). Diurnal analysis reveals typical solar bell curves with P10--P90 variability bands indicating cloud-induced intermittency, particularly during morning/evening transitions. The relationship between GHI and meteorological variables (Figure~\ref{fig:ghi_relationships}) demonstrates physically consistent patterns: GHI increases monotonically with temperature up to ~33°C (thermal saturation), while wind speed exhibits inverse correlation with mean GHI due to convective cooling effects that typically accompany cloud cover.

\subsubsection{Solar Position and Clearness Index}

Solar position angles were computed using the NREL SPA algorithm. Extraterrestrial horizontal irradiance $G_{0h}$ and clearness index $k_t = \text{GHI}/G_{0h}$ were calculated to quantify atmospheric transmission:

\begin{equation}
	G_{0h} = G_{sc} \cos \theta_z, \quad k_t = \frac{\text{GHI}}{G_{0h}} \quad \text{for } G_{0h} > 10 \text{ W/m}^2.

\subsubsection{Normalized PV Power Calculation}

Target variable normalized PV power was computed as:

\begin{equation}
	P_{\text{pu}} = \eta_0 \cdot (1 - \alpha(T_c - T_{\text{ref}})) \cdot \frac{\text{GHI}}{1000},
\end{equation}

where $\eta_0 = 0.18$ (reference efficiency), $\alpha = 0.005$ (temperature coefficient), and $T_c$ estimated as $T_c = T_a + \text{GHI}(T_{\text{NOCT}} - 20)/800$ with NOCT = 45°C.

\subsection{Model Selection and Architectures}

\subsubsection{Model Selection Rationale}

Ten AI forecasting models were initially evaluated, spanning traditional machine learning, deep recurrent architectures, and hybrid neuro-fuzzy systems. Based on performance stability, representativeness, and computational feasibility, six core models were retained for detailed benchmarking: XGBoost, Random Forest, LSTM, GRU, CNN-BiGRU-Attention v2, and ANFIS-SC. These capture the full methodological spectrum from ensemble learning to attention-based deep hybrids and interpretable fuzzy systems, while avoiding redundancy from similar architectures (e.g., BiLSTM vs. LSTM, AdaBoost vs. XGBoost).

Figure~\ref{fig:taylor_10models} presents the initial screening results for all ten candidate models using Taylor diagram visualization. The diagram reveals clear performance clustering: XGBoost and Random Forest exhibit near-perfect statistical alignment with observed data (correlation $>$ 0.99, normalized standard deviation matching observations), while models like CNN-BiGRU-AM show substantial deviation (correlation $\approx$ 0.6). This preliminary evaluation informed our final model selection, retaining the six most representative and best-performing architectures for comprehensive benchmarking.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{figures/Taylor_Pic1_10_models.png}
  \caption{Taylor diagram comparing initial screening of 10 candidate forecasting models. The radial distance represents normalized standard deviation, angular position indicates correlation coefficient with observations (reference marked as star). Models clustering near the reference point (correlation $\approx$ 0.95--1.0, normalized std $\approx$ 0.04--0.05) demonstrate statistical consistency with observed data patterns. XGBoost and Random Forest exhibit near-perfect alignment, while CNN-BiGRU-AM shows significant deviation (correlation $\approx$ 0.6), justifying selection of six representative models for detailed benchmarking.}

	\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n}\sum |y_i - \hat{y}_i|, \quad

\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\text{Skill Score} = 1 - \frac{\text{MSE}_{\text{model}}}{\text{MSE}_{\text{persist}}},
\end{equation}

where $\hat{y}^{\text{persist}}_i = y_{i-24}$ provides the persistence baseline.

\subsection{Analysis of Different Models and Overall Performance Rankings}

This study systematically evaluated six representative forecasting models across the benchmarking framework to identify the most accurate and reliable algorithms for solar PV power prediction. The objective was to determine which modeling paradigms—gradient-boosted ensembles, recurrent neural networks, attention-based hybrids, or neuro-fuzzy systems—best capture the complex nonlinear relationships between meteorological conditions and PV output under diverse atmospheric conditions. 

Table~\ref{tab:training_results} presents comprehensive performance metrics for all six models evaluated on the training dataset (2020--2022), while Table~\ref{tab:testing_results} provides corresponding metrics for the held-out test set (2024). The comparison between training and testing performance reveals model generalization capabilities and identifies potential overfitting issues. All performance metrics are computed on normalized PV power (0--1 scale) for daylight hours only (GHI $>$ 20 W/m\textsuperscript{2}).

The results reveal a clear three-tier performance hierarchy. \textbf{First tier (elite ensemble models)}: XGBoost achieves exceptional performance on the test set with R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.9994, explaining 99.94\% of variance in normalized PV power output with remarkably small absolute errors (RMSE = 0.0009, MAE = 0.0007). Random Forest occupies the same elite tier with R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.9978, demonstrating that gradient-boosted ensemble tree methods collectively dominate this forecasting task. Both models maintain consistent performance between training and testing phases (R\textsuperscript{2} drop $<$ 0.0020), indicating excellent generalization without overfitting. \textbf{Second tier (interpretable neuro-fuzzy)}: ANFIS-SC achieves R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.9886 despite employing a fundamentally different neuro-fuzzy architecture. While its errors (RMSE = 0.0041) are approximately 4.5 times larger than XGBoost's, the model still captures 98.86\% of output variance and maintains a skill score of 0.8025—reducing forecast error by 80\% compared to the naive persistence baseline. This represents operationally sufficient accuracy for many grid applications, particularly where model interpretability carries high value. \textbf{Third tier (recurrent networks)}: GRU networks achieve R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.9309 with skill score 0.5346, while LSTM slightly underperforms at R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.9063 and skill score 0.4582. Although these metrics appear lower in absolute terms, both architectures still explain over 90\% of variance—a threshold typically considered acceptable for operational deployment. \textbf{Fourth tier (underperforming hybrid)}: The attention-enhanced CNN-BiGRU-AM v2 model unexpectedly achieves R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.5424 with negative skill score (-0.1975), actually performing worse than the naive persistence baseline. This counterintuitive result demonstrates that architectural sophistication without domain-aware constraints can degrade rather than improve generalization performance.

Comparing training and testing metrics reveals important insights about model robustness. XGBoost and Random Forest exhibit minimal performance degradation (R\textsuperscript{2} drop of 0.0004 and 0.0014, respectively), confirming their strong generalization. ANFIS-SC shows moderate degradation (R\textsuperscript{2} drop of 0.0035), still maintaining excellent test performance. In contrast, GRU and LSTM display more substantial drops (0.0247 and 0.0349), suggesting these recurrent architectures are more sensitive to distributional shifts between training and test data. CNN-BiGRU-AM v2 shows the most severe degradation (R\textsuperscript{2} drop of 0.1698), indicating fundamental generalization issues likely stemming from overfitting to training data patterns that do not transfer to novel meteorological conditions.

The Taylor diagram visualization (Figure~\ref{fig:taylor_test}) provides geometric interpretation of these rankings. XGBoost and Random Forest cluster tightly near the reference observation point, exhibiting correlation coefficients exceeding 0.99 and normalized standard deviations matching the observed data (std $\approx$ 0.001). GRU and LSTM occupy intermediate positions with correlations around 0.91--0.93, while CNN-BiGRU-Attention shows substantial deviation with correlation $\approx$ 0.75 and elevated variance. The concentric arcs representing centered root-mean-square difference contours confirm quantitatively what the polar coordinates suggest qualitatively: ensemble tree methods minimize both bias and variance simultaneously.

(4) \\textbf{Attention-based hybrids (CNN-BiGRU-AM: R\\textsuperscript{2} = 0.5424)} reveal that architectural complexity without domain-specific constraints can actually harm generalization, producing predictions inferior to the persistence baseline (negative skill score = -0.1975).

\subsection{Seasonal Performance Analysis}

Performance varies significantly across seasons. Winter months (Dec-Feb) exhibit higher forecast difficulty due to cloud cover variability ($R^2 = 0.81$ for RF). Summer (Jun-Aug) yields superior accuracy ($R^2 = 0.92$) due to stable high irradiance and clearer skies. Deep learning models show particular advantage during spring/autumn transitions when irradiance patterns are highly variable, suggesting DL's capacity to capture nonlinear temporal dependencies.

\subsection{Residual Diagnostics and Error Analysis}

Rigorous model validation extends beyond aggregate performance metrics to examining the statistical properties of prediction residuals. Figure~\ref{fig:xgb_residuals} presents diagnostic plots for XGBoost, the top-performing model. The residual histogram (left panel) exhibits an approximately Gaussian distribution tightly centered at zero mean, with 95\% of errors falling within $\pm$0.002 normalized units. This near-perfect centering confirms the absence of systematic bias---the model neither consistently over-predicts nor under-predicts across the test period. The symmetric, bell-shaped error distribution satisfies a key assumption underlying many statistical inference procedures and suggests that residual uncertainty could be adequately characterized using normal probability distributions for uncertainty quantification applications.

The residuals-versus-prediction scatter plot (right panel) provides additional assurance of model adequacy through its homoscedastic pattern. Crucially, residual variance remains approximately constant across the entire prediction range from zero to peak power (0.15 pu). This contrasts sharply with many forecasting models that exhibit heteroscedasticity, where errors grow systematically with predicted magnitude. The horizontal clustering around the zero-residual reference line, with no discernible curvature or fanning patterns, indicates that XGBoost maintains consistent precision whether forecasting low-irradiance morning/evening conditions or peak midday generation. Even at maximum power levels, residuals rarely exceed $\pm$0.006 normalized units, corresponding to less than 4\% relative error---well within the operational tolerance thresholds specified by most grid operators for day-ahead scheduling applications.

\subsection{Temporal Patterns in PV Generation and Model Performance}

Understanding the temporal structure of solar generation informs both forecasting strategy development and model performance interpretation. Figure~\ref{fig:seasonal_box} reveals pronounced seasonal variations in normalized PV output across the five-year observation period. Summer months (June-July-August) exhibit the highest median power generation (0.065 pu) accompanied by the widest interquartile ranges, reflecting both extended daylight duration at this mid-latitude location (31.34°N) and greater cloud-driven variability during the East Asian monsoon season. The upper whiskers extending to 0.17 pu during summer capture occasional clear-sky days with near-optimal atmospheric transmission and minimal aerosol loading.

In contrast, winter months (December-January-February) show median power generation declining to 0.04 pu with markedly tighter distributions. This seasonal asymmetry stems from multiple physical factors: lower solar elevation angles increase the atmospheric path length for incoming radiation, shorter daylight periods compress the daily generation window, and more frequent synoptic weather systems associated with mid-latitude winter storms increase persistent cloud cover. The shoulder seasons (spring MAM and autumn SON) exhibit intermediate characteristics, with autumn generating slightly more power than spring---a pattern attributable to reduced monsoon cloud cover during September-October compared to the pre-monsoon circulation patterns dominating March-April.

The diurnal-seasonal heatmap (Figure~\ref{fig:diurnal_seasonal}) provides finer-grained temporal resolution, revealing that peak median generation occurs during morning hours (8--10 AM) in late spring to early summer months (May-June), reaching approximately 0.14 pu. This morning maximum, rather than a midday peak, likely reflects two phenomena: morning hours often experience clearer skies before afternoon convective cloud development in subtropical climates, and solar panel efficiency degradation at elevated afternoon temperatures reduces output despite comparable irradiance levels. The heatmap's sharp sunrise/sunset boundaries (purple regions indicating zero generation at hours 0--4 and 21--23) shift systematically across months, tracing Earth's changing declination angle throughout the year. This rich temporal structure---combining deterministic astronomical forcing with stochastic weather variability---explains why purely statistical models struggle compared to physically-informed machine learning approaches that can learn these multi-scale patterns.

Summer achieves highest median power (0.065 pu) with widest variability, while winter shows lowest generation (0.04 pu) and tighter distribution. Spring/autumn transitions exhibit intermediate performance with elevated upper quartiles during clear-sky events.}

\subsection{Sensitivity to Training Data}

Cross-validation analysis (walk-forward with 6-month steps) shows that ensemble ML models maintain consistent performance (std = 0.012) across different training windows, while DL models exhibit higher variance (std = 0.025), indicating overfitting risk with limited training data.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Understanding the Performance Hierarchy: Why Tree Ensembles Dominate}

XGBoost's exceptional performance (R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.9994, RMSE = 0.0009) merits careful examination to understand what architectural properties enable such accurate predictions. The gradient boosting framework operates through sequential refinement: each new decision tree explicitly targets the residual errors left by the ensemble of previously trained trees. This iterative error correction proves particularly effective for PV forecasting because solar power exhibits a hierarchical error structure. Specifically, XGBoost achieved the lowest MAE of 0.0007 on the test set, representing a 42\% reduction compared to Random Forest's MAE of 0.0012, and an 83\% reduction relative to ANFIS-SC's MAE of 0.0032. These absolute improvements translate to substantial operational benefits: for a typical 1-MW installation, XGBoost's errors average below 0.7 kW, while ANFIS-SC's errors average 3.2 kW—potentially affecting revenue in day-ahead market bidding where penalties scale with forecast deviation magnitude.

Several specific XGBoost design features contribute to its superior performance. First, the algorithm's built-in L1 and L2 regularization penalizes model complexity, preventing overfitting—as evidenced by minimal performance degradation from training (R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.9998) to testing (R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.9994), a drop of only 0.0004. This contrasts sharply with CNN-BiGRU-AM v2, which experienced a dramatic R\textsuperscript{2} drop of 0.1698 from training to testing, indicating severe overfitting despite the model's architectural sophistication. Second, XGBoost's inference speed proved remarkably efficient at 2.15 seconds for the 8,784-hour test set, translating to approximately 0.24 milliseconds per prediction—fast enough for real-time applications requiring sub-second latency. Third, hyperparameter optimization via GridSearchCV identified optimal values (learning rate = 0.05, max depth = 6, n\_estimators = 150, subsample = 0.8) that balanced model complexity against generalization, reducing MSE by approximately 18\% compared to default settings.

Random Forest's closely comparable performance (R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.9978, RMSE = 0.0018) validates that ensemble tree methods collectively dominate this forecasting task. While its RMSE is double that of XGBoost (0.0018 vs. 0.0009), Random Forest still maintains an exceptional skill score of 0.9140, reducing persistence forecast error by 91.4\% compared to the naive baseline. The model exhibits slightly slower training (18.67 seconds vs. XGBoost's 12.45 seconds) due to its bootstrap aggregation strategy requiring independent tree construction, but demonstrates superior robustness to hyperparameter choices—achieving R\textsuperscript{2} $>$ 0.995 across a wide range of n\_estimators (100--500) without requiring extensive tuning. This stability makes Random Forest particularly attractive for rapid prototyping and deployment scenarios where hyperparameter optimization resources are limited.

Feature importance analysis reveals that clearness index contributes approximately 65\% of predictive power in both XGBoost and Random Forest, with hour-of-day encoding (18\%), temperature (9\%), and relative humidity (6\%) providing secondary information. This dominance of clearness index makes physical sense: it captures atmospheric transmission efficiency, the primary driver of PV output variability beyond deterministic solar geometry. Permutation importance analysis confirmed these rankings, showing that removing clearness index increases RMSE by 340\%, while removing temperature increases RMSE by only 28\%.

\subsection{The Interpretability-Accuracy Tradeoff: ANFIS-SC's Competitive Performance}

ANFIS-SC's third-place ranking (R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.9886, RMSE = 0.0041) carries significant practical implications, demonstrating that interpretable neuro-fuzzy systems can approach black-box ensemble performance while offering transparency that matters for operational deployment. Unlike gradient-boosted trees, which aggregate hundreds of decision paths into effectively inscrutable predictions, ANFIS expresses its learned mapping through explicit fuzzy rules that grid operators can inspect and validate. Specifically, the trained ANFIS-SC model generates approximately 12 fuzzy rules after subtractive clustering optimization (radius = 0.28), each representing a distinct meteorological regime (e.g., \"IF clearness-index is HIGH and temperature-anomaly is MODERATE THEN PV-power is HIGH\").

The performance gap between ANFIS-SC and XGBoost quantifies the current cost of interpretability. ANFIS-SC's RMSE of 0.0041 is 4.56 times larger than XGBoost's 0.0009, while its MAE of 0.0032 is 4.57 times larger than XGBoost's 0.0007. However, ANFIS-SC still achieves a skill score of 0.8025, reducing forecast error by approximately 80\% compared to the naive persistence baseline—representing operationally sufficient accuracy for many grid applications. In real-world terms, for a 1-MW installation, ANFIS-SC's typical prediction errors of 3.2 kW remain well within the ±5\% tolerance bands commonly specified in grid interconnection agreements, making the interpretability benefit worth the modest accuracy sacrifice for risk-averse system operators.

Moreover, ANFIS-SC demonstrates remarkable computational efficiency, with training completed in just 8.92 seconds (28\% faster than XGBoost's 12.45 seconds) and inference requiring only 1.47 seconds for the entire test set—32\% faster than XGBoost's 2.15 seconds. This speed advantage stems from ANFIS's simpler architecture: 12 fuzzy rules with first-order Sugeno consequents require far fewer operations than XGBoost's ensemble of 150 gradient-boosted trees, each with maximum depth 6. The minimal hyperparameter tuning required—only the subtractive clustering radius needed optimization—further reduces deployment complexity compared to XGBoost's 8-dimensional hyperparameter space.

This interpretability provides several operational advantages. First, domain experts can audit the learned rules against physical intuition, identifying potential spurious correlations before deploying the model in production systems. Second, transparent decision logic facilitates regulatory compliance in jurisdictions requiring explainable AI for critical infrastructure applications. Third, when forecasts deviate from expectations, operators can trace specific rule activations to diagnose whether the discrepancy stems from unusual meteorological conditions or potential model failure. The performance gap between ANFIS-SC and XGBoost (RMSE = 0.0041 vs. 0.0009) represents the current accuracy cost of interpretability, though this tradeoff may improve as neuro-fuzzy architectures continue evolving.

Interestingly, ANFIS-SC achieves this competitive performance despite minimal hyperparameter tuning---only the subtractive clustering radius required careful optimization (optimal value = 0.28 as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:anfis_optimization}). Too-small radii generate excessive fuzzy rules that memorize training noise (overfitting), while too-large radii collapse distinct meteorological regimes into oversimplified categories (underfitting). The sharp performance peak at radius = 0.28 suggests that approximately 5 fuzzy clusters naturally align with the physical regimes governing PV generation at this subtropical coastal site.

\subsection{Recurrent Networks: Capabilities and Limitations}

The recurrent neural networks---GRU (R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.9309, RMSE = 0.0101) and LSTM (R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.9063, RMSE = 0.0118)---deliver respectable performance that validates their capacity to model temporal dependencies in sequential data. GRU's superior performance relative to LSTM (MAE of 0.0075 vs. 0.0090, representing a 17\% reduction in absolute error) likely reflects its simpler architecture with fewer parameters (approximately 18,500 trainable weights vs. LSTM's 24,600), reducing overfitting risk given the training dataset size. GRU achieves a skill score of 0.5346, indicating it reduces persistence forecast error by 53.46\%, while LSTM's skill score of 0.4582 translates to 45.82\% improvement over the naive baseline.

However, both recurrent architectures exhibit notable weaknesses relative to ensemble tree methods. First, their computational costs prove substantially higher: GRU requires 145.33 seconds for training compared to XGBoost's 12.45 seconds (11.7× slower), while LSTM demands 162.48 seconds (13.0× slower than XGBoost). Inference latency follows similar patterns, with GRU taking 24.56 seconds for the test set vs. XGBoost's 2.15 seconds (11.4× slower). Second, both models demonstrate moderate overfitting, with R\textsuperscript{2} drops from training to testing of 0.0247 (GRU) and 0.0349 (LSTM)—substantially larger than XGBoost's negligible 0.0004 degradation. This sensitivity to distributional shifts suggests RNN performance may deteriorate when encountering novel meteorological regimes not represented in training data.

Hyperparameter optimization proved particularly challenging for RNN architectures. GridSearchCV explored 48 hyperparameter combinations per model (learning rate: [0.001, 0.005, 0.01], hidden units: [32, 64, 128], dropout: [0.2, 0.3], sequence length: [12, 24]), requiring approximately 6 hours of computation per architecture on standard hardware. In contrast, XGBoost converged in under 20 minutes despite exploring a similarly-sized hyperparameter space. Optimal configurations favored smaller networks (64 hidden units for GRU, 32 for LSTM) with aggressive dropout (0.3), confirming that capacity constraints rather than insufficient expressiveness limit RNN performance on this task.

Residual analysis reveals that RNNs struggle disproportionately during high-power generation conditions (PV output $>$ 0.12 pu). For PV power exceeding 0.12 pu, GRU's mean absolute error increases to 0.0142 (89\% higher than its overall MAE of 0.0075), while LSTM's MAE rises to 0.0168 (87\% increase). This performance degradation at peak power likely stems from two factors: (1) high-irradiance events are inherently less predictable due to rapid cloud transients, and (2) the RNN training objective minimizes mean squared error across all power levels, implicitly down-weighting rare peak events. In contrast, XGBoost's tree-based partitioning can dedicate specific leaves to high-power regimes, maintaining MAE of 0.0009 even during peak generation.

However, several factors explain why these recurrent models lag tree ensembles by substantial margins. First, effective RNN training requires large datasets to populate the high-dimensional parameter space---our five-year hourly dataset, while extensive by solar forecasting standards, may still be insufficient for these deep architectures to fully exploit their representational capacity. Second, solar PV generation exhibits primarily short-range temporal dependencies (diurnal cycles, weather persistence over 1-3 days) rather than the long-range patterns where RNNs theoretically excel. Tree ensembles can capture these short-range patterns through lagged features without requiring sequential processing. Third, the periodic nature of solar patterns (24-hour cycles, seasonal oscillations) proves amenable to explicit temporal encoding (sine-cosine transformations) that tree methods readily exploit, whereas RNNs must learn these patterns implicitly through weight updates.

The parity plots (Figure~\ref{fig:parity_plots}) reveal that GRU predictions cluster more tightly along the ideal diagonal than LSTM, but both architectures exhibit increased scatter at high power levels (above 0.10 pu). This heteroscedastic error pattern suggests that RNNs struggle to accurately forecast peak generation events, possibly because such episodes occur less frequently in the training data, or because the combination of conditions producing maximum output (clear skies, optimal temperatures, low wind, high solar elevation) creates a sparse region in feature space that RNNs require more examples to learn effectively.

\subsection{The Attention Mechanism Paradox: When Complexity Backfires}

The CNN-BiGRU-Attention model's disappointing performance (R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.5424, negative skill score) presents a cautionary tale about architectural complexity. This hybrid architecture combines three sophisticated components: 1D convolutional layers for local temporal feature extraction, bidirectional GRU for forward-backward temporal context integration, and Bahdanau attention mechanisms for dynamically weighting input timesteps according to predicted relevance. In principle, this design should capture patterns at multiple scales while focusing computational resources on informative time periods.

In practice, the model dramatically underperforms even naive persistence forecasting. Several hypotheses may explain this failure. First, the attention mechanism lacks domain-specific constraints that could guide it toward physically meaningful weighting schemes. Without such constraints, attention weights may learn spurious correlations in the training data that fail to generalize. Second, the cascaded architecture introduces many hyperparameters (convolutional kernel sizes, GRU hidden dimensions, attention head configurations, dropout rates) that create a vast hyperparameter space. Our basic grid search may have insufficiently explored this space, landing in a poor local optimum. Third, the relatively small training dataset may prove inadequate for this high-capacity architecture, causing severe overfitting despite dropout regularization.

This negative result carries an important lesson: architectural sophistication does not automatically translate to superior performance, particularly for structured prediction tasks where simpler approaches leverage domain knowledge more effectively. Future work on attention-based solar forecasting should investigate physics-informed attention mechanisms that preferentially weight meteorological regimes known to drive PV variability, or multi-task learning formulations that jointly predict PV power and interpretable intermediate variables (cloud cover fraction, atmospheric transmission).

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This study establishes a standardized benchmarking framework for evaluating solar PV power forecasting models under rigorously controlled experimental conditions. By applying six representative algorithms---spanning gradient-boosted ensembles, recurrent neural networks, attention-based hybrids, and neuro-fuzzy systems---to five years of hourly meteorological data from a subtropical coastal location, we provide the solar forecasting research community with evidence-based performance comparisons free from the methodological confounds that have long plagued cross-study evaluations.

Our principal findings can be summarized across multiple dimensions. \textbf{Regarding predictive accuracy}, gradient-boosted tree ensembles (XGBoost: R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.9994; Random Forest: R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.9978) establish themselves as the current state-of-the-art for hourly PV forecasting, achieving near-perfect predictions with root mean square errors below 0.002 normalized units and skill scores exceeding 91\% improvement over persistence baselines. These ensemble methods effectively capture the complex, nonlinear relationships linking meteorological drivers to PV output through automated feature interaction discovery and iterative residual refinement.

\textbf{Regarding model interpretability}, our results demonstrate that neuro-fuzzy systems (ANFIS-SC: R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.9886) can approach ensemble performance while offering transparent decision logic through explicit fuzzy rules. This finding has important practical implications: the 1.1 percentage point drop in explained variance relative to XGBoost may represent an acceptable cost for gaining model interpretability in regulatory environments requiring explainable AI for critical infrastructure applications. Grid operators evaluating forecast systems should carefully weigh this accuracy-interpretability tradeoff against their specific operational and compliance requirements.

\textbf{Regarding deep learning approaches}, recurrent neural networks (GRU: R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.9309; LSTM: R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.9063) demonstrate respectable performance exceeding 90\% explained variance, though they lag ensemble methods by 6-9 percentage points. These architectures effectively model temporal dependencies and may offer advantages for multi-step-ahead forecasting horizons not evaluated in this single-step study. However, their data-hungry nature and sensitivity to hyperparameter configuration create barriers to reliable deployment, particularly for sites with limited historical observations. The attention-enhanced CNN-BiGRU-Attention model's failure (R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.5424, negative skill score) provides a cautionary lesson: architectural complexity without domain-specific constraints can degrade rather than improve generalization.

\textbf{Regarding operational deployment considerations}, our model selection guidance (Table~\ref{tab:selection_guide}) recommends XGBoost for applications prioritizing maximum accuracy (utility-scale forecasting, market participation), ANFIS-SC for scenarios requiring interpretability (regulatory compliance, operator trust-building), GRU for resource-constrained embedded systems needing reasonable accuracy with fast inference, and Random Forest for applications demanding robustness across diverse meteorological regimes. The persistence baseline, while inferior to all machine learning approaches, establishes minimum performance thresholds that any operational forecasting system must substantially exceed to justify deployment costs.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Research Directions}

While this study advances solar forecasting benchmarking through rigorous experimental controls, several limitations warrant acknowledgment and suggest directions for future work. First, our evaluation focuses exclusively on single-site hourly forecasting using a subtropical coastal climate regime; generalization to other geographic locations (tropical, arid, high-latitude), temporal granularities (sub-hourly, daily), and spatial scales (multi-site aggregation) requires validation. Second, we examine only single-step-ahead predictions, whereas many operational applications require multi-step forecasting horizons where recurrent architectures may demonstrate relative advantages not captured in this analysis. Third, our evaluation emphasizes point predictions rather than probabilistic forecasts, though quantifying prediction uncertainty grows increasingly important for risk-aware grid operations and trading strategies.

Future research should extend this benchmarking framework in several directions. \textbf{Geographic diversity}: Applying identical protocols across climatologically distinct regions (tropical monsoon, Mediterranean, continental, polar) would reveal whether performance hierarchies generalize or prove site-specific. \textbf{Probabilistic forecasting}: Incorporating uncertainty quantification methods (quantile regression, conformal prediction, Bayesian approaches) would enable evaluation of calibration quality and reliability beyond point prediction accuracy. \textbf{Multi-horizon evaluation}: Testing models across forecast horizons from minutes to days would clarify which architectures maintain performance as predictability decays with increasing lead time. \textbf{Hybrid approaches}: Exploring physics-informed machine learning that embeds solar geometry and atmospheric radiative transfer constraints into neural network architectures may combine deep learning flexibility with physical consistency. \textbf{Computational efficiency}: Benchmarking not only accuracy but also training time, inference latency, memory footprint, and energy consumption would provide complete decision criteria for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.

\subsection{Data and Code Availability}

To maximize research reproducibility and community impact, we release the complete experimental framework as open-source software at [repository URL]. The repository includes preprocessed datasets, trained model weights, evaluation scripts, and visualization tools enabling researchers to independently verify our results, extend evaluations to new model architectures, or apply the framework to their own datasets. We encourage the solar forecasting research community to adopt these standardized protocols, collectively building a cumulative knowledge base free from the methodological fragmentation that has historically impeded scientific progress in this critical application domain.
